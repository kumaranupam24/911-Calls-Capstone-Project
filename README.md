This is a Data Science based project on Analysis of 911 Call details. It involves the exploratory data analysis and data visualization of the frequency of 911 emergency calls made throughout the time of the year and also for which common reasons/incidents 911 calls are usually made during which part of the year.This project is developed on a 
Jupyter notebook using Python with 
Numpy 
Pandas 
Data analysis libraries 
Matplotlib  
Seaborn data visualization libraries. 
The dataset is used from Kaggle for data analysis.

# Feauter Selection

This first notebook contains all the steps and transformations I performed for the feature selection. You can find the information on the raw data in the following kaggle page. The kaggle datasets contain an extended descriptions of different aspect of the accidents, thus I've selected the most relevant and useful data for my analysis.
